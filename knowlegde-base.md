1. PropTypes
PropTypes is a library in React that provides a way to document and validate the expected data types of props passed to a component. It allows developers to specify the type of data expected in each prop and if it is required or not. By using PropTypes, developers can prevent common errors such as passing incorrect data types to a component or forgetting to pass required props.

PropTypes provide various validators to validate different types of data, such as string, number, boolean, object, array, function, etc. It also allows developers to create custom validators for specific use cases. When the data passed to a component doesn't match the expected type, PropTypes will print a warning message in the console, making it easier to debug and fix issues.

Props (properties) are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
